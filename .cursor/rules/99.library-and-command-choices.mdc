# Library and Command Choices

## Purpose

This rule governs general library and command selection preferences for the codebase, especially for cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure. Framework- or style-specific commands are documented in their respective rules. Azure-specific rules are now in their own file.

## OS Preferences
- Always use a Windows Powershell command
- Do not generate Linux command
