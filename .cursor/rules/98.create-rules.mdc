# Rules Authoring Guide

## Purpose

This rule defines the conventions and best practices for creating new rules in this codebase. It ensures that all rules are clear, discoverable, and maintainable, and that they follow a consistent structure and naming scheme.

## Rule Numbering & Naming Conventions

- **01. Core Rules:** Apply to the entire codebase (e.g., security, architecture, component design, error handling). Prefix: `01.`
- **02. Framework-Specific Rules:** For technology/framework-specific guidance (e.g., Next.js, React, Prisma). Prefix: `02.`
- **03. UI/UX Rules:** For user interface, styling, accessibility, and design system guidance. Prefix: `03.`
- **98. One-Time Operations:** For on-demand, user-triggered, or remediation operations (e.g., splitting large files, generating documentation). Prefix: `98.`
- **99. Program Execution Rules:** For rules governing scripts, commands, or programmatic actions on the target computer. Prefix: `99.`

- Use kebab-case for the rest of the filename, describing the rule's focus (e.g., `01.core-rules.mdc`, `02.next-js-rule.mdc`, `03.style-guide.mdc`, `98.func-split-large-files.mdc`).

## When to Create a New Rule

- When introducing a new architectural, process, or coding standard not covered by existing rules.
- When a new framework, tool, or major feature is added to the codebase.
- When a one-time or on-demand operation is needed (e.g., migration, refactor, documentation generation).
- When a new class of scripts or programmatic actions is introduced.

## Rule Structure

Each rule should include:

1. **Title:** A clear, descriptive heading.
2. **Purpose:** What the rule governs and why it exists.
3. **Scope:** Where and when the rule applies (entire codebase, specific framework, UI, etc.).
4. **Guidelines/Steps:** Actionable, step-by-step instructions or principles.
5. **Examples:** (Optional) Concrete examples or scenarios.
6. **References:** (Optional) Links to related rules or files using `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)`.

## Referencing Other Rules or Files

- Reference other rules or files using the format `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)`.
- When a rule depends on or extends another, clearly state the relationship in the Purpose or References section.

## Best Practices

- Write rules in clear, concise language. Avoid ambiguity.
- Use numbered or bulleted lists for steps and principles.
- Keep rules focused—split large or complex rules into smaller, related rules if needed.
- Update rules when processes or technologies change.
- Add a change log section for major updates (optional but recommended).
- **Whenever you create a new rule or make a significant update to an existing rule, update the `readme/cursor-rules-guide.md` file to reflect the change. This ensures the guide remains accurate and up-to-date for all contributors.**

## Example Rule Structure

```
# Example Rule Title

## Purpose
Describes what this rule governs and why.

## Scope
Where and when this rule applies.

## Guidelines
1. Step one
2. Step two

## References
- [01.core-rules.mdc](mdc:01.core-rules.mdc)
- [02.next-js-rule.mdc](mdc:02.next-js-rule.mdc)
```

## Additional Notes
- Place all rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
- Do not edit rule file metadata; only update the content section.
- Review existing rules for style and structure before authoring a new one.
