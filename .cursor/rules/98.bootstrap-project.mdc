# Project Bootstrap Rule

## Core Principles

When bootstrapping any new project, always follow these fundamental principles:

### 1. Official Documentation First
- **ALWAYS** refer to the official documentation for the framework, library, or tool being used
- Never assume or guess bootstrap commands - verify them against official sources
- Check for the latest version of bootstrap commands as they may change between versions
- Look for official CLI tools, scaffolding tools, or project generators

### 2. Use Official Bootstrap Commands with pnpm
- **NEVER** manually create project structures or manage dependencies yourself
- Always use the official bootstrap/scaffolding commands provided by the framework
- **Prefer pnpm** as the package manager for all Node.js projects
- Examples of preferred approaches:
  - `pnpm create react-app` for React projects
  - `pnpm create next-app` for Next.js projects
  - `pnpm create vue@latest` for Vue.js projects
  - `pnpm create svelte@latest` for Svelte projects
  - `dotnet new` templates for .NET projects
  - `rails new` for Ruby on Rails projects
  - `django-admin startproject` for Django projects
  - `cargo new` for Rust projects

### 3. Avoid Self-Managed Dependencies
- Do not manually install and configure build tools, bundlers, or development dependencies
- Let the official bootstrap process handle:
  - Build configurations (webpack, vite, etc.)
  - Development server setup
  - Testing framework configuration
  - Linting and formatting tools
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Package.json scripts and dependencies

## Package Manager Guidelines

### pnpm Preference
- **Always use pnpm** for Node.js projects when possible
- Benefits of pnpm:
  - Faster installation and better disk space efficiency
  - Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies
  - Better monorepo support
  - Compatible with npm registry and most npm commands

### Bootstrap Commands with pnpm
- Use `pnpm create` instead of `npx create` when available
- If `pnpm create` is not supported, use `pnpm dlx` as alternative to `npx`
- Examples:
  - `pnpm create react-app my-app` instead of `npx create-react-app my-app`
  - `pnpm create next-app my-app` instead of `npx create-next-app my-app`
  - `pnpm dlx create-expo-app my-app` for Expo projects

## User Interaction Guidelines

### 4. Guide Users Through Interactive Processes
When bootstrap commands require user input:

- **Explain each option** before running interactive commands
- **Provide context** for configuration choices
- **Recommend default options** for beginners unless specific requirements exist
- **Document the choices made** for future reference

Example guidance format:
```
The bootstrap process will ask you several questions:
1. Project name: Use kebab-case (e.g., my-awesome-app)
2. TypeScript: Choose 'Yes' for better type safety
3. ESLint: Choose 'Yes' for code quality
4. Tailwind CSS: Choose based on your styling preference
5. Package manager: Select 'pnpm' when prompted
```

### 5. Post-Bootstrap Verification
After running bootstrap commands:

- Verify the project structure was created correctly
- Test that the development server starts successfully with `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`
- Confirm all dependencies were installed properly with `pnpm install`
- Check that basic commands (build, test, lint) work as expected
- Ensure pnpm-lock.yaml file is generated (not package-lock.json or yarn.lock)

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### Web Frameworks
- For React: Use `pnpm create react-app` or `pnpm create vite@latest` with React template
- For Next.js: Use `pnpm create next-app` with appropriate flags
- For Vue: Use `pnpm create vue@latest` or Vue CLI with pnpm
- For Angular: Use Angular CLI `ng new` then switch to pnpm
- For Svelte: Use `pnpm create svelte@latest`

### Backend Frameworks
- For Node.js/Express: Use express-generator with pnpm or framework-specific CLIs
- For Python/Django: Use `django-admin startproject`
- For Python/FastAPI: Use official templates or cookiecutter
- For .NET: Use `dotnet new` templates
- For Spring Boot: Use Spring Initializr

### Mobile Development
- For React Native: Use `pnpm dlx react-native init` or Expo CLI with pnpm
- For Flutter: Use `flutter create`
- For Ionic: Use Ionic CLI with pnpm

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't** manually create package.json files
2. **Don't** manually install build tools like webpack or babel
3. **Don't** copy configurations from other projects without understanding
4. **Don't** skip reading the official getting started guides
5. **Don't** use outdated bootstrap commands or tutorials
6. **Don't** mix package managers (avoid npm/yarn if pnpm is being used)

## Best Practices

1. **Always check for updates** to bootstrap tools before starting
2. **Read the generated README** files for project-specific instructions
3. **Commit the initial bootstrap** as a clean starting point
4. **Document any post-bootstrap customizations** made to the project
5. **Keep bootstrap tools updated** for future projects
6. **Use pnpm consistently** across all Node.js projects in the workspace
7. **Add pnpm-lock.yaml** to version control, exclude node_modules

## Troubleshooting Bootstrap Issues

If bootstrap commands fail:
1. Check Node.js/runtime version compatibility
2. Clear package manager caches (`pnpm store prune`)
3. Try with pnpm first, fallback to npm/yarn only if necessary
4. Check network connectivity and registry access
5. Refer to official troubleshooting documentation
6. Look for known issues in the project's GitHub repository
7. Ensure pnpm is installed globally: `npm install -g pnpm`

Remember: The goal is to get a working, properly configured project with minimal manual intervention and maximum adherence to community standards and best practices, using pnpm as the preferred package manager for optimal performance and dependency management.
