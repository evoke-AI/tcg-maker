# Function and Component Search Rule

## Purpose
Prevent duplication and promote reuse by always searching for existing functions and components before creating new ones. Ensure the codebase remains maintainable and discoverable as it grows.

## Scope
This rule applies to all contributors (human and AI), for both backend (functions, services) and frontend (components, hooks, utilities) code.

## Guidelines
1. **Mandatory Structure File Check:**
   - Before creating any new function or component, you must check `readme/structure.md` for an existing entry that matches the intended purpose.
   - If the structure file does not exist or does not contain the needed information, use code navigation/search tools to look for existing logic.
2. **No Duplication:**
   - Only create a new function/component if no suitable existing one is found.
3. **Mandatory Structure File Update:**
   - Whenever a new function/component is created, you must update `readme/structure.md` to document its name, location, and purpose.
   - This update is required for all code reviews and PRs.
4. **Checklist for Contributors:**
   - [ ] Checked `readme/structure.md` for existing logic
   - [ ] Searched the codebase if not found in structure file
   - [ ] Only created new logic if no suitable match exists
   - [ ] Updated `readme/structure.md` with the new function/component
   - [ ] Referenced this rule in the PR or code review
5. **Automation Encouraged:**
   - Where possible, automate these checks and updates in AI workflows and developer tooling.
